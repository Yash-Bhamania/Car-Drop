                In its constant endeavour to improve green logistics and provide an expeditious freight transportation
                solution, Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation (DFCC) has tied up with a startup to provide vehicle
                transportation services between the Western DFC's New Rewari Station in Haryana to Kalamboli (Navi
                Mumbai) and other cities. <br></p>

            <p> DFCC has joined hands with Cardrop India Private Limited to transport vehicles in the safest and fastest
                mode. <br></p>

            <p> The service envisages the transport of new and used vehicles from various cities in India in vehicle
                transportation carriages called new modified goods (NMG) coaches which will offer protection from the
                vagaries of weather and human intervention by providing a safe and secure mode of transport in
                approximately two days from the present more than five days. <br></p>

            <p> It is envisaged that this service will run approximately 150 rakes on DFC alignment in a year offering
                huge benefits to the customer. <br></p>

            <p> Approximately 100 vehicles can be transported in each rake of 25 carriages with each carriage equipped
                to transport vehicles. Currently, to transport 100 vehicles approximately 13 huge trucks are required
                which would consume precious fossil fuels thereby increasing CO2 emissions and causing road congestion.
                <br></p>

            <p> The vehicle transportation service will help decongest roads, increase fuel savings, reduce wear and
                tear and slash CO2 emissions. DFCC has offered all assistance to the logistics partners at New Rewari
                Station of DFC, Kalamboli (Navi Mumbai) station of Central Railway and other stations of Indian
                Railways. <br></p>

            <p> DFCC envisages overall reduction of 457 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over a 30-year period, and by
                adopting such innovative transport solutions will be aiming for higher savings in CO2 towards net zero
                emissions by 2070 in line with the nation's objective of bringing in net zero emissions.</p>

            <p>The railways, which has been aiming to be the preferred transporter for finished. goods, will for the first time ferry cars using dedicated freight corridors (DFC). </p>

            <p>   On July 10, the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCC) received an order for 25 new modified goods (NMG) wagons to trans- port 75-80 four-wheelers from Haryana to southern areas such as Chennai and Bengaluru, an official said. </p>
                
            <p>   The order, to be executed on the western DFC, will earn the freight corporation 10-12 lakh. This is the first time that DFCC will fulfil a four-wheeler delivery as the primary agency. </p>
                
            <p>   Even though DFCs have been opening up in parts, most of the transportation of noncore freight items still happens on tracks belonging to the Indian Railways. Since the order was placed, the freight corridor arm of the railways has started procuring automobile loading ramps and is planing to develop more goods sheds to cater to industry-specific needs of the sector as it expects more traffic. However, due to a lack of a dedicated route between northern and southern India, the firm will use the western DFC from
                Rewari up to Mehsana or Palanpur in Gujarat, from where the consignment will be handed over to the Indian Railways for the rest of the journey. Due to higher train speeds on the freight corridor, the detour from the north to west to south is unlikely to have a negative impact on the time of delivery. </p>
                <p>    DFCC sees this as a chance to become the preferred transporter for automobiles. Most four-wheelers are transported by road, which is more expensive and polluting than rail. With the rising cost of logistics and expectations of climate action from companies, auto firms have been considering shifting their transportation networks to railways. ‘The successful delivery of this order will increase supplier confidence in terms of timeliness and cost reduction. Once both the eastern and western DFCs have been completed, we will have an unbroken dedicated supply chain only for freight, where our key metrics will be even better. We have serious plans to tap into the market for transporting both new and used cars,” the official quoted above said. While the eastern DFC is likely to be completed by June 2023, recurring issues in Maharashtra are likely to push the date for the western corridor to March 2024, or even beyond that.
